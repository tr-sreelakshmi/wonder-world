        <p>The Colosseum is the great oval amphitheater in the center of Rome where gladiators once fought for their
            life. The largest amphitheater ever built, it was constructed from sand and stone over eight years, from
            AD72 to AD80. The colossal structure could hold 80,000 spectators, arranged in a circular ring around the

            started in 1632,[16] and the mausoleum was completed in 1648, while the surrounding buildings and garden
